This is a readme thingo.


Because Github.

TODO
====

- Sort out  the Connection module so that you pass a URL into the constructor
and then the connection is established. When you make a call, pass in a function
to be called when the call finishes. Possible with a boolean flag pass in the 
first parameter indicating the success of the  call?
- Implement the Registration page
- Implement the Forgot Password  stuff.
- Clean out dependencies.
- Add a debug-mode-only logger

- Lastly, look at the following gulpjs modules: jshint, concat, bump, 
coffeelint, size, closure-compiler
- Look into using Coffeescript for this project rather than vanilla JavaScript.
(much less painful, IMO)
