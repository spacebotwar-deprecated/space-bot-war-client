space-bot-war-client
====================

This is a readme thingo. Because Github made me do it.

Setup
=====

The following are the steps you'll need to take to get this thing running.

- Install [Git](http://git-scm.com)
    - On Ubuntu: ` $ sudo apt-get install git`
- Install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org)
- ` $ git clone http://github.com/spacebotwar/space-bot-war-client`
- ` $ cd space-bot-war-client`
- Use our funky Perl script to do the rest!
    - ` $ perl sbw.pl setup`

Now hit ` $ perl sbw.pl help ` for instructions on how to develop with us!


TODO (In no particular order)
===========================
- Some sort of Chat system
- Some sort of code editor (Kind of done, no syntax highlighting)
- Setup [log4js](http://log4javascript.org/)
- Start work on the Steampunk CSS styling/art
- Perhaps a loading screen? Something to display while the JavaScript is
being pulled in? Maybe?? :P
