TODO:

-Sort out  the Connection module so that you pass a URL into the constructor
and then the connection is established. When you make a call, pass in a function
to be called when the call finishes. Possible with a boolean flag pass in the 
first parameter indicating the success of the  call?

-Implement the Registration page

-Implement the Forgot Password  stuff.

-Clean out dependencies.
